# HuaYun-BJUT-MIP-Cloud-Dataset
## A new ground-based cloud dataset.

The pictures in GBCID (Ground Based Cloud Image Dataset) are from the proprietary equipment of [HUAYUN SOUDING company](http://www.hysdqx.com/). The GBCID dataset contains 25119 cloud images. According to the World Meterological Organization’s genera-based classification recommendation, we divide into 11 different categories： Ac, Sc, Ns, Cu, Ci, Cc, Cb, As, No, Cs, St. The criteria for each cloud classification are shown in Table 1. And the number of each cloud category is shown in Tabel 2. We also compared HBMCD with other ground-based cloud datasets, and the results are shown in Figure 1.
Finally, The classification results of the pictures have been recognized by the professional staff of HUAYUN SOUDING company.



Table 1 The criteria for each cloud classification.

Scientific name  | Abbreviation  | Cloud characteristics
 ---- | ----- | ------  
 Cumulus  | Cu | Having an upward projection of a circular arch; clouds similar in size to fists; margins clear.  
 Cumulonimbus  | Cb | Clouds are thick and broccoli-like; edges are blurred.
 Stratocumulus  | Sc | Clouds are generally fist-sized and loosely distributed, clustered, traveling and wavy, often grey or gray-white.  
 Stratus  | St | Clouds lay evenly; cover a large area, almost all over the sky; mostly grey.  
 Nimbostratus  | Ns | Clouds are low and amorphous; often covered with the sky and completely obscured the sun and moon; clouds are fluffy and dark grey. 
 Altostratus  | As| Clouds are thicker and covered with the sky; the sun passes through almost no halo; clouds often have striped structures and are grayish-white or grayish-blue.
 Altocumulus  | Ac | Clouds are small and distinct in outline; thin clouds are white, visible Sun-Moon outline, thick clouds are dark gray, the outline of the Sun-Moon is not clear; clouds are oval, tile-shaped, fish scales or water wavy distribution. 
 Cirrus  | Ci | Thin and transparent; white and shiny; the clouds are filamentous and horsetail-like.  
 Cirrostratus  | Cs | The bottom of the cloud has a filamentous structure; the cloud body is thin enough to pass through the sun and the moon; and there is a distinct halo under the sun's illumination. 
 Cirrocumulus  | Cc | Clouds are very small, white and shiny; they are thin white scales; they are often arranged in rows and in groups. 
 No Cloud  | No | There are no clouds in the sky.
